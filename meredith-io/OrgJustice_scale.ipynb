    "R, like many programming languages, has a copious selection of packages from which to choose. Packages are essentially bundles of pre-developed code/scripts that are used to accomplish a task. For instance, the ```readr``` package contains an assortment of functions (e.g., ```read_table```, ```read_delim```) used to import a variety of data files (e.g., .csv, .xlsx, .zip, etc.). We will begin by loading some useful packages and no worries, one can also load packages as needed instead of all at once, though the ordering has an effect. \n",

    "Some function names may overlap with other packages and R will notify you of this by printing a message displaying what function name is being masked. To call a specific function from a package, simply type the name of the package followed by two colons and the function name (e.g., ```readr::read_csv()``` (this is considered \"best practice\" in R programming but not often followed from my extensive Google searches). \n",
